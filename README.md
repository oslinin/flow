# Hardhat Project on flow

Smart Contract on Flow Testnet: 
[https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0x43D904c78181044ACF7072911A3c8ad9500B270C](https://evm-testnet.flowscan.io/address/0x43D904c78181044ACF7072911A3c8ad9500B270C)

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell

yarn add --dev @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts dotenv
yarn hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/ClickToken.ts --network flowTestnet

```
